    Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying 
    speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a 
    reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that 
    process language.

Dyslexia is not due to problems with intelligence, hearing or vision. Most children with dyslexia 
can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays 
an important role.

Though there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. 
Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never 
too late to seek help.""")
